There is limited evidence of the unmet needs and experiences of adults with attention de ﬁcit hyperactivity\\ndisorder (ADHD). Previous research in this area is predominantly quantitative by nature, few studies employing\\nqualitative approaches. This study seeks to provide a deeper insight into the lived experiences of adults with ADHD\\nwithin Western Ireland.\\nMethods. A qualitative design, consisting of semi-structured face-to-face interviews with a clinical sample in the Sligo/\\nLeitrim area. Participants were eligible for this study if they screened positive for symptoms of ADHD, and diagnosed\\nwith ADHD with the Conners ’ Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV. In total, 11 participants completed this\\nresearch. The interviews were open ended and exploratory, adopting a phenomenological approach.\\nResults. Thematic analysis was used to explore three main themes; The Burden of symptoms of ADHD, Perceived\\nPositive and Negative Effects of ADHD and Challenge of Accessing Services, each with several subthemes.\\nConclusion. This research highlights the experiences of adults with ADHD. It is important for practitioners to be aware of\\nthe perceived positive and negative effects of the disorder, and how it can impact on their patient ’s lives. In addition,\\nbecoming aware of the stigma associated with ADHD can help clinicians improve upon individual treatment plans to\\nmeet their patient’s needs. It is important to note that this sample experienced co-morbid diagnoses and so this may limit\\nthe interpretation of the ﬁndings. Further research in this area could explore patient’s attitudes towards receiving a formal\\ndiagnosis of ADHD.\\nReceived 12 September 2016; Revised 14 April 2017; Accepted 15 May 2017\\nKey words: ADHD, adult, attention de ﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, qualitative research.\\nIntroduction\\nAttention de ﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a\\nneurodevelopmental disorder, which many recognise\\nas a childhood disorder (Rosler et al. 2010). However,\\na review of the literature as well as longitudinal studies\\nof individuals with ADHD reveals that symptoms\\nof ADHD can persist into adulthood (Faraone et al.\\n2006; Davidson, 2008). Regardless of this literature,\\nthere is limited evidence of the unmet needs and\\nexperiences of adults with ADHD (Matheson et al.\\n2013). It is common among adults with ADHD to\\nexperience high rates of co-morbidities; three in four\\npatients have at least one or more co-morbid psychia-\\ntric disorder (Faraone & Biederman, 1998). In some\\ncases, these other psychiatric disorders can dominate\\nthe picture, causing symptoms of ADHD to be over-\\nlooked or even undiagnosed. Therefore, individuals\\nwith ADHD can be under-treated and may fail to\\nreceive a diagnosis of ADHD and suf ﬁcient treatment\\nwhich can result in life-long challenges and dif ﬁculties.\\nResearch has shown that adults with ADHD often\\ncomplain of psychological and psychosocial dif ﬁculties\\nwhich can impair functioning, well-being, and health-\\nrelated quality of life in adulthood (Nigg et al. 2002;\\nMurphy & Adler, 2004; Adler et al. 2006; Weiss et al.\\n2010). Compared with adults without ADHD, adults\\nwith ADHD have a higher risk of developing depres-\\nsion, anxiety, substance abuse, anti-social behaviours,\\nlowered socio-economic status due to work-related\\nstress (Faraone et al. 2000; Schubiner et al. 2000; Barkley\\net al. 2004; Wilens & Dodson, 2004), social skills de ﬁ-\\nciencies due to difﬁculties in affect recognition (Rapport\\net al. 2002), increased anger expression (Richards et al.\\n2006), are more likely to commit anti-social acts and\\nbe arrested (Barkley et al. 2004), and an increased risk\\nfor motor vehicle accidents (Swensen et al. 2003).\\nADHD can have a negative impact on ﬁnances, career\\nopportunities, income, retirement funds (due to\\nimpulsive spending), friendships groups, families and\\nco-workers (Brod et al. 2012). As a result, there is often a\\nsubstantial psychological and psychosocial burden\\n* Address for correspondence: Dr D.

Without treatment, these impairments\\ncan have detrimental effects on quality of life.\\nStigma is an underlining dif ﬁculty faced by many\\npeople suffering from mental illness, ADHD in parti-\\ncular. Previous research has noted some individuals\\ndemonstrate hesitance and reluctance to engage and\\ninteract socially with their fellow peers experiencing\\nthe disorder. One such study was carried out in an\\nAmerican University. This study consisted of under-\\ngraduate students rating the likelihood that they would\\nrather interact with a peer described as having ADHD,\\na peer with general medical problem, or a peer with an\\nambiguous ﬂaw such as perfectionism (Canu et al.\\n2008). Peers described as having ADHD were rated less\\nsocially desirable than peers with the other two\\ndescriptions. It is unclear as to whether stigma stems\\nfrom a lack of awareness of ADHD or popular myths\\nabout the illness in that it is only restricted to childhood.\\nAs reasons remain unclear, researchers have requested\\nfor further research to examine the stigma associated\\nwith adults with ADHD (Lebowitz, 2013).\\nA signi ﬁcant amount of the available literature on\\nadults with ADHD has used samples from the United\\nStates and the United Kingdom, and researchers have\\nrequested further research with various methodologies\\nto shed light on the experience of ADHD in adulthood\\n(Lebowitz, 2013). Therefore, this research seeks to\\nexplore the experiences of adults with ADHD from a\\nclinical sample in Western Ireland. The rationale of\\nthis study is simple; understanding the impairments\\nassociated with ADHD in adulthood and the stigma\\nattached to this illness can help practitioners be more\\naware of the dif ﬁculties faced by individuals accessing\\nsupport services and possible barriers that may affect\\ntreatment adherence, particularly within a Western\\nIrish context. Previous research among individuals\\nwith ADHD have mostly employed quantitative\\napproaches (Young, 2005; McCarthy et al. 2013). How-\\never, qualitative approaches are more appropriate at\\nproviding an in-depth insight into patients’ experiences\\n(Pope & Mays, 1995). Like any illness or disability, early\\nintervention can improve quality of life, self-esteem,\\noverall functioning, outcome and long-term prognosis\\n(Agarwal et al. 2012; Shaw et al. 2012; Harpin et al. 2013;\\nMatheson et al. 2013). Therefore, this research is\\nessential to ensuring timely and early support is\\navailable to those who require it. There is very little\\nunderstanding of the perspectives of adults with\\nADHD reported in the scienti ﬁc literature (Young et al.\\n2008; Henry & Hill Jones, 2011), particularly regarding\\nthose with untreated ADHD. Therefore, it is hoped that\\nthis research study will contribute to the literature by\\ninforming clinicians of the lived experiences of adults\\nwith ADHD.\\nAims of the study\\nThe aims of the study were twofold: to examine the\\nfunctional impairments of ADHD and to investigate\\nperceived attitudes and stigma.\\nMethod\\nMethodological approach\\nA qualitative approach using semi-structured inter-\\nviews was used as it aims to elicit a detailed and in-\\ndepth description of the participants ’ experiences and\\nviews. A literature review was carried out to establish\\ntopics to guide the interview in order to elicit com-\\nmentary in several areas, including daily life, social,\\npsychological, and physical functioning, negative\\neffects of ADHD, positive effects of ADHD, experiences\\naccessing support services/treatment centres and\\nattitudes towards ADHD. Demographic information of\\neach participant was recorded in order to generate\\ndescriptive statistics.\\nRecruitment\\nThe recruited sample was a sub-sample of a larger\\nepidemiological study (Adamis et al. 2016). Consecutive\\npatients attending any Adult Mental Health Services\\nout-patient clinics of Sligo/Leitrim were invited to\\nparticipate. Participants completed the Adult ADHD\\nSelf-Report Scale and the Wender Utah Rating Scale.\\nExclusion criteria applied were as follows: age less than\\n18 or above 65, illiterate, non-English speaking patients.\\nThose who scored positive in both scales were further\\nassessed (second stage of the initial study) with the\\nConners’ Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV\\n(CAADID) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric\\nInterview (M.I.N.I.) (Sheehanet al. 1998) for diagnosis of\\nco-morbid disorders. Consequently participants who\\ncompleted the CAADID and who were considered to\\nhave an ADHD diagnosis were invited to complete this\\nresearch; a qualitative interview in 2016. Theﬁrst 17 who\\nhave been diagnosed with ADHD according to CAADID\\nwere contacted by telephone or post to take part in this\\nresearch.\\nStudy setting\\nThe interviews took place in an out-patient clinic or\\nmental health service participants were familiar with. The\\ninterviews were conversational and semi-structured\\nbased on previous literature and following a guide that\\nwas reviewed by an expert in qualitative research.\\nWith the participant ’s consent, interviews were audio\\nrecorded and transcribed in order to be analysed.\\nOn average, the interviews lasted ~40 minutes each.\\n2 C.

This\\napproach encourages participants to discuss the topic\\nin their own words, focusing on the human experience\\nsubjectively.\\nResults\\nIn total, 17 out-patients were approached to participate.\\nTwo individuals declined to participate and four\\nindividuals were unable to be contacted, resulting in 11\\nparticipants completing the semi-structured individual\\ninterviews; nine male and two female with an age range\\nof 20 –54 years (mean age 37.64 years, SD = 11.83).\\nEight of the participants were currently employed, and\\nthree were unemployed. Four participants were single,\\nfour were married and one was cohabiting. One\\nparticipant had obtained an I.T. degree, one had a\\nUniversity degree, seven had completed education as\\nfar as the Leaving Certi ﬁcate, one only had Junior\\nCertiﬁcate education and one had a Post-Graduate\\ndegree. Co-morbidity was diagnosed based on use\\nof the M.I.N.I. Each participant had more than\\none diagnoses with the majority being mood dis-\\norders ( n = 8; 72%) following by generalised anxiety\\ndisorder ( n = 5; 45.5%) and panic disorders and/or\\nphobias (n = 5; 45.5%).\\nThree main themes were found: The Burden of\\nsymptoms of ADHD, Perceived Positive and Negative\\nEffects of ADHD and Challenge of Accessing Services.\\nEach main theme contained a few subthemes which\\nare described in greater detail below. Quotes from\\ninterviews are provided, followed by the number\\nin parenthesis (x) attributed to the interviewee.\\nEllipses ( …) mark parts omitted from the quote and\\nwords within brackets are clari ﬁcations made by the\\nauthors.\\nThe burden of symptoms of ADHD\\nInattention and poor concentration\\nThe impairment associated with poor concentration,\\ndistractibility and inattention were described the extent\\nand the burden of experien cing symptoms of ADHD in\\nadulthood. Inattention and lack of concentration resulted\\nin signi ﬁcantly dif ﬁculties with basic tasks such as\\nreading, watching television, writing a letter, forgetting\\nthings (in terms of relation ships), multi-tasking and\\ngetting ‘side tracked by something else ’ (2). Often in\\nadulthood, demands become more complex and\\nindividuals are expected to function more responsibly\\nand independently, yet poor abilities to maintain\\nconcentration exacerbate the burden of living with\\nADHD. The majority of participants often compare their\\nconcentration levels with others and are aware of the\\nimpact this has on their lives.‘It r yw a t c h i n ga n dl e a r n i n g\\nnew things, but I just don ’t have the concentration for it\\nlike others would’ (10), ‘My concentration levels delay me\\nfrom completing a task … so yeah it would probably\\ntake me longer to complete a task than the average\\nperson’ (5), ‘Ij u s tw o u l dn o th a v eb e e na b l et oh a v e\\nfocused for nearly as long as everyone else… It deﬁnitely\\nputs me behind in college’ (6).\\nHyperactivity and impulsivity\\nParticipants reported difﬁculties related to hyperactivity\\nand impulsivity noting a tendency to blurt things out\\nwithout suf ﬁc i e n tt h o u g h ti nt e r m so fs a y i n gt h i n g s\\nuncontrollably, not completing tasks, negative future\\nconsequences and more subtly through relationships.\\n‘It affects my work in that I just can ’tg e tt h i n g sd o n e…\\nthere are a lot of little jobs where I do 80% of it and then\\nI leave the other 20%, and kind of avoid it and go and\\ndo something else’ (3), ‘Iw o u l ds a yt h a tId o n’th a v ea\\nﬁlter on what I say … never aggressively, but there ’s\\njust no ﬁlter … I just sit on my hands and try not to say\\nanything’ (8), ‘Say I have €20 in my pocket for shopping\\nand I bumped into someone on the street and they asked\\ni fIw a n t e dt og od ot h i s ,t h e nIm i g h ts p e n dt h e€20,\\nall my shopping money and have no food then for the\\nweek … l i k eIl o s tal o to fw e i g h tt h el a s tt w om o n t h s…\\njust from being impulsive with money I have set aside for\\nfood and stuff’ (4), ‘I just think it’sag r e a ti d e aa tt h et i m e\\nbut then I realise maybe it ’sn o tag r e a ti d e a… let’ss a y\\nI’m painting the garden fence and I’ve a lot of that to do\\nand that’s ﬁne … and instead of ﬁnishing the fence, I go\\nover and start painting the shed ’ (5).

I ’ve had so many\\njobs since I was 16 its ridiculous ’ (4). Participants descri-\\nbed how they felt like they failed to ful ﬁl their potential,\\nyet knowing they are capable of doing more: ‘I’mn o t\\ndoing the work as well as I should be because I know that\\nI can work very well. If I don ’t, I ’m automatically seen\\nby other people as poor performance so then I would\\nbe putting myself under more pressure to get the\\nwork done … deﬁnitely procrastination is a big thing\\nfor me ’ (9). Again, participants re ﬂected upon their\\nchildhood and how undiagnosed symptoms may have\\nlimited their educational opportunities from an early age:\\n‘I spent half of my time in the corridor, outside of the\\nclassroom. One half in the corridor and the other half in\\nthe principal’so f ﬁce’ (4), ‘I would have to really really\\nlearn things and then they were gone. And that used to\\nupset me and I couldn’tu n d e r s t a n d .T h i n g sw o u l dg oi n\\nwhen I learned it and then that night it was gone …\\nI suppose things just got harder, to retain all of the\\ninformation’ (2).\\nPerceived positive and negative effects of ADHD\\nEvery cloud has a silver lining\\nSome participants noted the bene ﬁts of some of the\\nsymptoms experienced.‘I kind of like being like that at the\\nsame time as well. Doing things on impulse is always\\nbetter rather than stuff that you plan out, it never works’\\n(4). ADHD could perhaps contribute to a ful ﬁlled and\\nexciting life ‘kind of deﬁnes me as a person I suppose …\\njust the impulsiveness to go and do something that\\nsomebody else wouldn’th a v ed o n e’ (4). One participant\\nnoted the advantages of having an overactive mind,\\nlooking to the bright side of being easily distracted.\\n‘I suppose sometimes it is useful (being easily distracted),\\nif I\\n’m stuck in my own head a bit too much and I ’mj u s t\\nover thinking things an d stuff like that, it ’sd e ﬁnitely a\\ngood thing to be able to let your mind wander a bit, not\\nto think about anything too heavy’ (6). It was suggested\\nthat being impulsive and unpredictable can make a person\\nmore likeable. ‘Maybe the spontaneous aspect, people\\nseem to enjoy that’ (8).\\nLow self-conﬁdence and self-esteem\\nA lot of participants reported psychosocial effects of\\nsymptoms of ADHD. For example, some participants\\nreported lack of self-con ﬁdence and self-esteem pre-\\nvented them from taking part in new experiences: ‘I get\\nfrustrated a lot of how I lack in college work, I would\\njust be very easily distracted and then just lower self-\\nesteem. Like it can happen before I go to do something\\nand then getting frustrated during. Before I start\\nsomething I think what ’s the point, I can ’t do that\\nanyways’ (6). Negative comparisons to others affected\\nmaking new friends: ‘I suppose I would have been\\na little less inclined to get to know people … I felt\\nlike everybody was way ahead of me anyways ’ (6).\\nConﬁdence appeared to limit possibilities in terms of\\nemployment prospects: ‘I never stuck at anything …\\nthen I guess I have no conﬁdence either. I never thought\\nI would be able to do it … I wouldn ’t go for a job or\\nI would never try for things ’ (3), and functioning at\\nwork ‘I know I should be doing it quicker and I can do it\\nquicker’ (5). Low self-con ﬁdence and self-esteem had\\nseveral consequences during childhood, causing frus-\\ntration and embarrassment compared with peers: ‘I get\\nfrustrated because everyone else can do it and I can ’t\\nand I get frustrated out of that ’ (11), ‘It made me a bit\\nnervous, I realised that they were remembering and\\nI wasn’t’ (2).\\nCoping\\nA sense of disorganisation was evident throughout\\nthe interviews which was considered debilitating and\\ndraining. ‘I get distracted with work or that and just\\ngetting frustrated and feeling like I can ’t do it and I get\\ndown on myself that I ’\\nm not good enough so it ’s just\\nlike being distracted and also just feeling like I can ’td o\\nit anymore, getting frustrated and giving up. So I de ﬁ-\\nnitely struggle with that kind of thing ’ (6), ‘I do pro-\\ncrastinate, again that would be quite typical because\\njobs often seem very big and overwhelming ’ (7). The\\nimpression from interviews was that daily tasks, such\\nas household chores, clothes washing, packing a bag,\\nmaking breakfast can appear impossible and over-\\nwhelming. ‘When I wake up in the morning, just the\\nthought of having to do all of that, I mightn ’t bother\\ndoing that … because that time in the morning when\\nI’m just after waking up, any series of tasks like that\\ncomplicated would be insurmountable, I would want\\nanother half an hour just staring there beforehand ’ (9).\\nStrategies were employed to overcome these chal-\\nlenges. ‘One trick that I try to teach myself in general\\nwas what I’ve learned from mental health tools is to try\\nand do the next little thing and not think of all\\nthe things that I have to do.

Coping\\nwith symptoms of ADHD in adulthood was described\\nas something you just had to accept. ‘You just manage,\\nit’s like someone with a limp, you just manage to walk.\\nI suppose you just kind of brush it to the side and learn\\nto get on with things ’ (5).\\nChallenge of accessing services\\nStigma\\nPerceived stigma towards mental health in general was\\ndiscussed as an issue for both the person experiencing\\nmental health dif ﬁculties and their families. Going to\\nhospital and attending the psychiatric services were\\nconsidered the most severe and unwanted forms of\\ntreatment. ‘Well I would say I had a huge resistance to\\nPsychiatry … because to me that was another downhill\\nstep … as long as I didn’t go to a Psychiatrist that meant\\nI was ok. And then at that point, it was as long as\\nI haven ’t been institutionalised ’ (7), ‘They (my family)\\ncan’t really handle mental health issues. Like if I had\\ncancer, it would be ok ’ (7). The majority of participants\\ndiscussed what they thought ADHD was and con-\\nfessed that they believed it to be restricted to childhood.\\n‘When I heard of ADHD I used to always think it\\nwas hyperness … I thought it was just a childhood\\nthing’ (2), ‘I often heard about it (ADHD) in kids really\\nmore so than adults. The impression I got is that it\\nwould be kids just throwing tantrums … I always\\nthought it was unruly kids ’ (5), ‘People question is\\nADHD made up, is it an excuse for boldness ’ (9).\\nADHD is viewed in a negative light, and stigma\\nattached to the disorder may arise from character\\nportrayals in the media. ‘the bad character in that had\\nADHD so it’s not seen in a positive light. It might not be\\na positive thing ’ (8).\\nDiscussion\\nADHD is typically regarded as a childhood disorder\\nwith little attention given to adults with ADHD,\\nwho often go unnoticed and undiagnosed. The scarce\\nliterature that is available employs quantitative\\nmethods; therefore this qualitative methodology\\nprovides further insight into ADHD in adulthood. The\\nmain aim of this research was to the experience of\\nassociated with ADHD in adulthood, as well as the\\nperceived stigma attached to the disorder. This research\\nhighlights the dif ﬁculties and challenges faced by an\\nIrish clinical population who have remained undiag-\\nnosed until adulthood.\\nThe perceived burden and sense of impairment\\nassociated with ADHD symptoms was highlighted\\npersistently through the interviews is in-keeping\\nwith previous research in this area, suggesting\\nthat symptoms of ADHD persist into adulthood. The\\nnegative effects of the symptoms were quite dominant\\nthroughout the interviews, however there were some\\npositive effects associated with symptoms of ADHD.\\nSome of the participants viewed their impulsivity in a\\npositive light and felt it made them more likeable to\\nothers, whereas others noted how impulsivity affected\\ntheir work, social life and completing daily tasks such\\nas household chores.\\nParticipants in this research often felt and identi ﬁed\\nthemselves as different to other people. This difference\\nwas noticed retrospectively in childhood, while in\\neducation, and highlighted when in relationships.\\nThe ﬁndings suggest that symptoms of ADHD such as\\ninattention, poor concentration, hyperactivity and\\nimpulsivity may have affected the participants ’\\nability\\nto remain focused in school making the earlier years an\\nunpleasant period which increased the likelihood\\nof falling behind their peers resulting in reduced self-\\nesteem and self-con ﬁdence. This in turn may have\\nresulted in the feeling of missed opportunities and\\nfailing to ful ﬁl potential.\\nStigmatisation was explicitly recognised as an issue\\nthat the general public and clinicians need to be aware\\nof. There was a huge under awareness of the disorder,\\nparticularly the fact that it can persist into adulthood.\\nADHD is viewed in a negative light with one participant\\nmaking reference to a popular TV show portraying a\\n‘bad’ character with ADHD implying it makes children\\nuncontrollable. This stigma may have implications during\\nthe diagnostic process. Clinicians need to be aware\\nof the stigma associated with the disorder and thus can\\nmaintain the appropriate sensitivity. The perceived\\nstigma can also affect treatment adherence and coopera-\\ntion with the services. It is clear from the ﬁndings that\\nparticipants beneﬁted the most when accessing both\\nPsychiatry and Psychology services.

The sample were\\npredominantly male and contained only Caucasian\\nparticipants. It is important to note that individuals\\nwho are less inclined to access and cooperate with the\\nmental health services in the Sligo/Leitrim area may\\nhave different experiences and views of ADHD com-\\npared with those who voluntarily participated in this\\nresearch.

In recent years, many pub-\\nlished papers consider more than one field of study which has led to a significant increase \\nin the number of inter-field and interdisciplinary articles. Therefore, we can analyze the \\nsimilarity/dissimilarity and convergence/divergence of research fields based on topic anal-\\nysis of the published papers. Our research intends to create a methodology for studying \\nthe evolution of the research fields. In this paper, we propose an embedding approach for \\nmodeling each research topics as a multidimensional vector. Using this model, we measure \\nthe topic’s distances over the years and investigate how topics evolve over time. The pro-\\nposed similarity metric showed many advantages over other alternatives (such as Jaccard \\nsimilarity) and it resulted in better stability and accuracy. As a case study, we applied the \\nproposed method to subsets of computer science for experimental purposes, and the results \\nwere quite comprehensible and coherent.\\nKeywords Topic evolution\\xa0· Topic embedding\\xa0· Scientometrics\\xa0· Informetrics\\xa0· Data \\nmining\\xa0· Similarity metrics\\nIntroduction\\nNowadays, numerous scientific papers are published daily and the volume of them has \\nincreased over last years (Fernández-Isabel et\\xa0 al., 2020).

Some research \\nworks, particularly interdisciplinary studies, involve diverse research disciplines. As a \\nresult, the correlation between research topics is not considered static and may evolve over \\ntime. For example, machine learning and data mining are research areas considered as sub-\\nsets of “Computer Science” (CS). However, nowadays, not only do they contribute to other \\nCS research topics, but they also have found many applications in non-CS research. There-\\nfore, we can study the situation of each research topic among all research areas, and we can \\nanalyze trends, changes, and evolution of research topics.\\nIn this study, a “research topic” refers to the “Field of Study” (FoS), defined by the \\nMicrosoft Academic Graph. The FoS is a classification of publication records created \\nusing entity filtering and iterative graph link analysis (Jung & Yoon, 2020). However, \\nresearch areas change over time and are neither constant nor static in their graph network. \\nTherefore, the study of “topic evolution” concentrates on tracking topic developments and \\nchanges over the years. These changes may include the emergence of new topics, mov -\\ning topics away from each other, getting closer, or the death of a topic (Chen et\\xa0al., 2017). \\nTopic evolution studies can help decision-makers such as politicians and administrators \\nto understand the trends of research changes better and make more solid decisions (Qian \\net\\xa0al., 2020). Moreover, it also helps researchers to enhance their scientific path and gain \\nbetter insights that are unknown about their desired research directions (Evans & Rzhetsky, \\n2011). One of the disciplines that assists the studies on this issue is Scientometrics, also \\nknown as the “science of science”, which studies the quantitative aspects of science (Van \\nRaan, 1997). The topic evolution analysis is one of the Scientometrics sub-fields that stud-\\nies the evolution of scientific topics over time. Due to the rapid growth of the sources of \\ninformation in today’s world, the study of topic evolution has received significant attention \\nin recent years (Song et\\xa0al., 2014).\\nDue to the importance of computer science in recent research and its interdisciplinary \\nnature, this paper aims to propose a methodology for studying topics evolution in computer \\nscience. The results and outcome of such a study have many applications, including career \\nselection of researches, development of interdisciplinary researches, funding, and assess-\\nment of research projects (Taheri & Aliakbary, 2022). This study employed an embedding \\napproach to model each Field of Study (FoS) as a vector of real numbers representing a \\ngroup of researchers’ shared research interests. In this context, “embedding” means to map \\na concept into a finite numeric representation. Nowadays, embedding methods have found \\nmany applications in machine learning tasks such as natural language processing (NLP) \\nand graph processing (Masood & Abbasi, 2021; Guo & Caliskan, 2021). Various Fields \\nof Study (FoSs) are transformed to the vector space by employing our proposed embed-\\nding method. Consequently, each FoS can be represented in a fixed-sized low-dimensional \\nnumeric vector. One of the advantages of mapping FoSs into the vector space is to ease \\nmathematical operations and calculate the similarity measures on different FoSs.\\nThis paper proposes a method for tracking research topic changes over time based on \\nthe published scientific articles. Unlike most of the existing methods, we will not directly \\nutilize the text of the papers. Instead, we take advantage of each article’s relative FoSs \\nthat are already provided in the dataset. Therefore, the similarity of different FoSs is com-\\nputed based on the proposed embedding of the research topics, which is much less expen-\\nsive than text-based natural language processing methods. We can investigate the trend of \\nchanges in different sub-fields of computer science research in recent years based on our \\nproposed topic embedding method. It will be seen that our proposed method has the abil-\\nity to calculate the distances between topics that have no relations to each other. Instead'),\n",

Then in “Methodology” sec-\\ntion , the proposed method is presented. in “Results” Section reports the results of this \\nresearch, and finally, the paper is concluded in “Conclusion”section , where the future \\nworks are also suggested.\\nRelated works\\nMany approaches have been adopted for the study of topic evolution patterns. This section \\nbriefly surveys existing methods related to topic evolution analysis, topic modeling, and \\ntopic embedding.\\nTopic evolution analysis methods seek to determine how research topics change over \\ntime. Jung and Yoon (2020) used the change in similar authors’ interests to measure the \\nevolution in research topics. In another work, Qian et\\xa0al. (2020) defined a hierarchical topic \\nmodel as a tree in which each node represents a research topic, and its children are sub-\\ntopics of that node. Therefore, the changes in children’s structure over time denotes the \\nevolution of the parent topic. The networks based on articles or authors can also be utilized \\nfor topic evolution analysis. For instance, Krenn and Zeilinger (2020) presented an algo-\\nrithm based on semantic networks that are built from the published scientific literature. In \\nthis network, vertices denote concepts (topics), and edges indicate the relationship between \\nconcepts. This research applies link prediction methods to investigate what concepts will \\nbe related to each other in the future. Many related methods are also based on the analysis \\nof the article citations. For example, Kay et\\xa0al. (2014) used patent co-citation frequencies \\nto find important and trending technologies, and He et\\xa0al. (2009) proposed an iterative topic \\nevolution learning framework using citation relationships between articles to examine the \\nevolution of topics. Articles keywords are one of the features that can be used in this area. \\nTo investigate the formation of interdisciplinary areas, Jian et\\xa0al. analyzed the evolution of \\nthe keywords (Xu et\\xa0al., 2018). Detecting emerging topic in the future is one of topic evo-\\nlution goals. Liang et\\xa0al. (2021) proposed a method for predicting emerging topics. They \\ndefined a popularity score for topics under study to forecast emerging topics in the future.\\nIt is worth noting that topic evolution analysis methods are not restricted to analyzing \\nscientific research topics. They have found several applications in social media mining and \\nstudying opinion formation patterns. The rise of social media and content-publishing plat-\\nforms created an excellent opportunity for the study of topic evolution in order to track \\nsubjects, or topic shifts on social media (Sayyadi et\\xa0 al., 2009; Becker et\\xa0 al., 2009). For \\ninstance, Huang et\\xa0al. examined the changes of educational topics in social media (Huang \\net\\xa0al., 2020), and Alam et\\xa0al. studied social topic changes based on hashtag co-occurrence \\n(Alam et\\xa0al., 2017). Furthermore, Kalyanam et\\xa0al. (2015) performed a new approach based \\non topic discovery and evolution (TDE) in social media contexts. They adopted a model \\nbased on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) that merges social context and textual \\ninformation for news articles on Twitter. Allan (2002) presented one of the pioneering \\nresearch works in topic evolution for tracking new events change in the stream of news sto-\\nries. This method is basic research in the topic evolution area, which focuses on studying \\ntopics evolution based on text streams. Emerging phenomena in today’s world have also \\nprovided an opportunity for topic evolution researches. for example, Zhang et\\xa0al. (2021)'),\n",

Also, Ebadi et\\xa0al. proposed a method \\nbased on natural language processing and machine learning to help decision-makers to \\nidentify main covid-related topics (Ebadi et\\xa0al., 2021).\\nMost of the existing topic evolution researches are based on topic modeling. Topic mod-\\nels are statistical approaches to discover the hidden semantic structure in a collection of \\ndocuments (Blei & Ng, 2003; Blei, 2012). In topic modeling methods, each document is \\nrepresented by multiple topics with different degrees of association (Belford & Greene, \\n2020). Topic models have found many applications in natural language processing (Jelodar \\net\\xa0al., 2019). In many topic modeling methods, the article’s textual content (and sometimes \\nonly its abstract) is used to model a topic. In other words, the texts of the articles may \\ndefine the nature of a scientific area. For instance, word distribution can be considered in \\nthe articles’ texts. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Hofmann, 2001; Blei & Ng, 2003) \\nis one of the first topic modeling methods based on NLP techniques. It is also one of the \\nmost popular approaches in topic modeling (Dieng et\\xa0al., 2020; Jung & Yoon, 2020). LDA \\nadopts a bag of words approach to mine topics in the documents’ corpus. Dynamic topic \\nmodeling (Blei & Lafferty, 2006) is also a well-known topic modeling approach, which \\nfocuses on word transitions of topics in fixed time-slots. Nowadays, Short texts published \\nin social networks have created a good opportunity for researchers in the field of topic \\nmodeling. For example, Rashid et\\xa0 al. (2019) presented a fuzzy topic modeling (FTM) \\napproach to model topics in large-scale short text documents. Topic modeling techniques \\ncan be applied to a specific field‘s lierature to examine how topic under that field evolve. \\nFor example, Kim et\\xa0al. (2020) prposed a topic model to analyze trends on blockchain tech-\\nnology. They utilized Word2Vec and k-means methods to represent a context of a corpus \\nand they examine treds annually.\\nEmbedding approaches are among the main methods of extracting or modeling text top-\\nics. Methods such as Word2Vec (Le & Mikolov, 2014), GloVe (Pennington et\\xa0al., 2014), \\nfastText (Bojanowski et\\xa0al., 2017) and probabilistic fastText (Bojanowski et\\xa0al., 2017) are \\nwidely applied in this field. Similar to such methods, Wang et\\xa0al. (2019) proposed a neural \\ntopic modeling approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). They mod-\\neled topics by Dirichlet prior and used a generated network to achieve semantic patterns \\namong latent topics.\\nThe main aim of this paper is to investigate methods for quantifying convergence and \\ndivergence of research topics. In this context, topic evolution analysis methods can provide \\na tool for analyzing how two specific topics react to each other in different periods. For \\nexample, Gaul and Vincent (2017) formed topics as content-based document clusters and \\nthen detected the similarity between clusters in different periods. Furthermore, semantic \\nchanges of words over time are detected by Rudolph and Blei (2018) by performing word \\nembedding and analyzing the semantic changes of word embedding in different periods of \\ntime. Additionally, the writers of this paper have provided a method to determine the con-\\nvergence or divergence of research topics in artificial intelligence in earlier works (Hari-\\nkandeh et\\xa0al., 2021). It has been attempted to offer more thorough features of the benefits \\nof the suggested technique in this article, as well as to display more thorough reports of the \\nevolution of the topics, in addition to evaluating it in another domain (computer science).\\nAlthough many existing topic evolution analysis methods examine text content tran-\\nsitions (such as top words used in each topic), (Blei & Lafferty, 2006), the process of \\nchanging a topic can be identified without considering the content (text) under topics. For \\ninstance, co-citation analysis (Small, 1973) and co-word analysis (Callon et\\xa0al., 1983) are \\nutilized for topic evolution researches in recent years.

Therefore, in this paper, we \\nadopted a topic co-occurrence-based method in the articles.\\nMethodology\\nAs discussed in the previous section, there are several approaches to model research topics. \\nIn this article, we embed each topic as a point in the multidimensional space. In this sec-\\ntion, we review our proposed method for embedding research topics and how we use it to \\ncalculate the distance between the research topics. The proposed distance metric will meas-\\nure the distance between research topics and their convergence and divergence over time.\\nAssumptions\\nWe assume that there is a fixed and limited set of known research topics in computer sci-\\nence studies called “Field of Study” (FoS). For example, “Data Mining” and “Computer \\nSecurity” are among FoSs under computer science. This paper aims to analyze the evolu-\\ntion of these FoSs in computer science studies. We also assume that we have access to a \\ndataset of published scientific papers in computer science. We will analyze the papers in \\norder to find patterns of topic evolution among the FoSs. For each paper in the dataset, we \\nassume an already known set of research topics (FoS) related to the paper. For instance, a \\npaper might be specified with different FoSs such as “data mining”, “computer security”, \\nand “internet privacy”. Nowadays, research articles may consider several different research \\ntopics. We assume that the higher the ratio of the involvement of two specific topics (FoSs) \\nin the articles, the closer the two topics are. Therefore, we propose a simple model for \\ncomputing the similarity of FoSs over time.\\nQuantified similarity among\\xa0the\\xa0research topics\\nSuppose that X is one of the n existing fields of study ( X ∈{ FoS1, FoS2, ..., FoSn} ) and \\nAi(X) is the set of all the papers that are related to X, published in year i. We consider the \\nJaccard similarity between two FoSs (X and Y) in the year i denoted by Similarityi(X, Y) as \\ndescribed in Eq.\\xa01:\\nEquation\\xa0 1 represents a similarity metric which indicates how much two FoSs X and Y are \\ninvolved in the same research articles published in the year i. Then, this similarity metric \\ncan be utilized for topic embedding. In order to examine the evolution of a topic (FoS) \\nover time, we embed each of the n topics as a numeric vector. For each year i, the topic X \\nis embedded as a vector named ⃗Vi(X) which is described in Eq.\\xa0 2, in which Y1, ..., Yn are the \\nresearch topics (FoSs).\\n(1)Similarityi(X, Y)= /uni007C.varAi(X)∩ Ai(Y)/uni007C.var\\n/uni007C.varAi(X)∪ Ai(Y)/uni007C.var\\n(2)⃗Vi(X)= < Similarityi(X, Y1),Similarityi(X, Y2), ...,Similarityi(X, Yn) >'),\n",

Subsequently, we calculated the \\naverage distance rank for each FoS pair in each of the periods mentioned above. In the next \\nstep, we calculated the difference between the ranks in these periods, and which is called \\nΔRank as defined Eq.\\xa0 4. In this equation, Rank(X, Y)[i..j] is the average distance rank of the \\nFoS pair (X, Y) in the period from year i to j inclusive. Negative ΔRank indicates the con-\\nvergence of the two topics, while positive ΔRank demonstrates their divergence. Therefore, \\nthe most converging topics are those with the smallest ΔRank (the negative ΔRank with \\nthe largest absolute value). Table\\xa0 3 shows the FoSs that have had the most convergence in \\nrecent years. Although Data mining and Distributed computing are not very close (they \\nstand about  274th place among 528 topic pairs), they are becoming more and more similar \\nin recent years since the similarity rank is improved from 401 to 274. In other words, these \\ntwo topics show the minimum ΔRank , which indicates they are moving towards each other, \\nand therefore, more research that considers both of the topics is being published in recent \\nyears. A witness to the convergence of these two topics may be the development of a field \\nnamed as “distributed data mining,” which deals with extracting data from various infor -\\nmation sources (Zeng et\\xa0al., 2012). The same interpretation may also be considered for the \\nother rows of Table\\xa03.\\nTopic trends\\nSo far, we have examined the evolution of each pair of FoSs according to their pairwise \\ndistances and convergence/divergence patterns over the years. Nevertheless, it is also pos-\\nsible to consider the amount of change in every FoS in recent years separately in topic evo-\\nlution studies. In this regard, Fig.\\xa0 4 shows the topic changes in recent years. For instance, \\nthe figure shows that the “Pattern Recognition” topic has experienced the most variation \\namong the Computer Science research topics in recent years. In this figure, colors indicate \\nthe amount of change in a research topic (FoS) throughout recent years.

However, is this similarity meaningful? To answer this question, we consider ten \\nclosest topics to each of these three topics, based on the Jaccard-similarity definition \\n( Similarityi(X, Y) as defined in Eq.\\xa0 1)). Table\\xa0 4 shows the most similar topics to each of \\n“Telecommunications”, “Computer architecture”, and “Machine learning” subjects. By \\nreviewing this table, it is understood that “Computer Architecture” has seven common \\nsimilar topics to “Telecommunication”, while it has only one similar topic to “Machine \\nLearning”. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider “Computer Architecture” more similar to \\n“Telecommunication” than to “Machine Learning”. This case was an intuitive example of \\nthe priority of embedded-based distance over the Jaccard-based distance.\\nAs another intuitive case, we consider the trend of distance changes between two sample \\nresearch topics, “Database” and “Computer Hardware”, which is illustrated in Fig.\\xa0 5. In \\nthis figure, the trend of changes is seen both in terms of the Jaccard-based and the embed-\\nding-based distance. The changes in the Jaccard-based method display many fluctuations, \\nwhile in the embedding method, these changes are smoother and more constant. This is \\nbecause the state of other FoSs contributes to the definition of the embedding-based dis-\\ntance metric, keeping it from sudden inappropriate changes.\\nConclusion\\nThis paper established a framework for investigating the evolution of research topics and \\ntheir convergence and divergence patterns. To this purpose, we proposed a method for \\nembedding each research topic in a numerical vector representation. Then, we proposed \\na distance metric to calculate the amount of dissimilarity among research topics. Based \\non this methodology, we utilized a dataset of published papers in the field of computer \\nscience, and we performed a case study on research topics evolution in this area. We pre-\\nsented comprehensive reports to illustrate the evolution of different computer science sub-\\ntopics in recent years.\\nTable 4  Most Similar Topics to Telecommunication, Computer Architecture, and Machine Learning\\nThe pair < Telecommunication, ComputerArchitecture > has more common topics (topics with bold texts) \\nthan the pair < ComputerArchitecture,MachineLearning > (italics topics)\\nTelecommunications Computer Architecture Machine Learning\\nComputer network Embedded system Data mining\\nLibrary science Parallel computing Pattern recognition\\nReal-time computing Computer engineering Algorithm\\nComputer engineering Computer hardware Theoretical computer science\\nComputer security Operating system Natural language processing\\nAlgorithm Real-time computing Information retrieval\\nOperating system Simulation Computer vision\\nSimulation Multimedia Data science\\nDistributed computing Distributed computing Speech recognition\\nMultimedia Computer network Multimedia'),\n",

Moreover, it causes varying degrees of harm to\\nvarious extra-articular systems. In the general population, the\\nprevalence of RA ranges from 0.5% to 1%, with a higher\\nincidence in women than in men ( 1). RA leads to functional\\nimpairment, reduced work capacity, and a lower quality of life,\\nsubstantially burdening individuals and society ( 2, 3). Furthermore,\\nRA is associated with a signi ﬁcantly higher mortality rate than the\\ngeneral population, with approximately 40% of patients with RA\\nsuccumbing to cardiovascular disease ( 4, 5). Thyroid dysfunction,\\nencompassing hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, subclinical\\nhyperthyroidism, and subclinical hypothyroidism, is a common\\nendocrine disorder diagnosed pr imarily through biochemical\\nindicators such as thyroid s timulating hormone (TSH),\\ntriiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine (FT3),\\nand free thyroxine (FT4). The prevalence of hyperthyroidism ranges\\nfrom 0.2% to 1.3% ( 6, 7), while that of hypothyroidism varies from\\n0.2 to 5.3% ( 6, 8). Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism could\\nimpact various bodily systems, including the integumentary,\\nmuscular, skeletal, cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, endocrine,\\nand circulatory systems. While most studies have suggested a link\\nbetween RA and thyroid dysfunction ( 9), one study found no\\nsigni ﬁcant difference in the incidence and prevalence of\\nhypothyroidism between patients with and without RA ( 10).\\nTherefore, the potential causal relationship between RA and\\nhypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism requires further investigation.\\nMost of our insights into the relationship between hypothyroidism/\\nhyperthyroidism and RA are derived from observational studies,\\nwhich are susceptible to reverse causality, selective bias, and\\nconfounding variables. Therefo re, further research employing\\ninnovative methodologies is warranted.\\nMendelian randomization (MR) is one such technique that\\nutilizes genetic variation as an instrumental variable to assess causal\\nrelationships between exposures and speci ﬁc outcomes ( 11).\\n2 Method\\n2.1 Data sources\\nWe acquired summary statistics for RA from the MRCIEU GWAS\\ndatabase available at https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/. The pooled GWAS\\ndata, involving individuals of European ancestry, comprised a\\npopulation of 58,284 for subsequent analysis (GWAS ID: ieu-a-832),\\nwith 14,361 cases and 42,923 control participants ( 12). We obtained\\nsummary data from the publicly available FinnGen Biobank for the\\nGWAS datasets associated with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.\\nThe dataset for hypothyroidism (GWAS ID:ﬁnn-b-E4_HYTHYNAS)\\ncomprised 26,306 cases and 187,684 controls, while hyperthyroidism\\n(GWAS ID: ﬁnn-b-AUTOIMMUNE_HYPERTHYROIDISM)\\ncomprised 962 cases and 172,976 controls. In these datasets,\\nhypothyroidism was deﬁned as “Hypothyroidism, other/unspeciﬁed,”\\nand hyperthyroidism as “Autoimmune hyperthyroidism. ” Data\\nregarding smoking quantity were extracted from the GWAS and\\nSequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use (GSCAN) ( 13)\\n(cigarettes per day: GWAS ID: ieu-b-25, sample size: 337,334).\\nSummary-level data for alcohol intake frequency were obtained from\\nthe UK BioBank (GWAS ID: ukb-a-25, sample size: 336,965). Genetic\\ninstruments associated with BMI were sourced from a previously\\npublished GWAS study ( 14). We obtained these data from two\\nconsortia: the Genetic Investig ation of Anthropometric Traits\\n(GIANT) consortium and the Genetic Epidemiology of Adult Health\\nand Aging Study (GERA) consortium (GWAS ID: ebi-a-GCST006368,\\nsample size: 315,347).\\nTo minimize bias due to population strati ﬁcation, we focused\\nexclusively on individuals of European ancestry. All datasets are\\navailable for download from the IEU GWAS database at this link:\\nhttps://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/datasets/.\\nA detailed description of the data source is provided in\\nSupplementary Table 1 .\\nSince all the data were derived from publicly accessible studies,\\nour research did not require patient consent or ethical clearance.\\n2.2 Study design\\nOur study design comprised two primary steps. First, we\\nperformed a two-sample univariate analysis, using RA as the\\nexposure variable, and examined its association with\\nhypothyroidism/hyperthyroidi s ma st h er e s p e c t i v eo u t c o m e s .\\nS u b s e q u e n t l y ,w ep e r f o r m e da n o t h e rt w o - s a m p l eu n i v a r i a t ea n a l y s i s ,\\nusing hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism as the exposure variables, and\\nassessed their relationships with RA as the outcomes. In a second step,\\nto ensure that any causal effects were not inﬂuenced by factors such as\\nBMI, smoking quantity, and alcohol intake frequency, a multivariate\\nanalysis was conducted to account for the impact of these variables.\\nLai et al. 10.3389/fendo.2023.1256208\\nFrontiers in Endocrinology frontiersin.org02'),\n",

Three critical assumptions must be met to obtain\\nreliable casual estimates in MR studies: 1) IVs should exhibit a\\nstrong association with the exposure; 2) IVs should not be\\nassociated with any potential confounders that might affect the\\nrelationship between the exposure and outcome; 3) IVs should\\nexclusively in ﬂuence the outcome through the exposure ( 15, 16).\\nFigure 1 depicts a detailed description.\\nFirstly, we identi ﬁed independent single nucleotide\\npolymorphisms (SNPs) signi ﬁcantly associated with the exposure\\n(P<5×10-8). We conducted SNP clustering with a window size of\\n10,000 kb and an R2<0.001 threshold to remove linkage\\ndisequilibrium (LD). Subsequently, we checked all the exposure-\\nrelated SNPs in the PhenoScanner database ( http://\\nwww.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/ ) to identify any SNPs\\nassociated with potential confounders (BMI, smoking, alcohol\\nconsumption) and the outcome (P<5×10 -8). We extracted SNP\\neffects from the outcome GWAS dataset and harmonized the\\nimpact of the exposure and outcome. We excluded palindromic\\nSNPs with ambiguous results (EAF >0.42). We employed the MR-\\nPleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) method to\\nidentify and remove potential outliers ( 17). Finally, we assessed\\ninstrumental strength using the F-statistic ( F = N−k−1\\nk /C2R2\\n1−R2 ),\\nfollowing the procedures outlined by Burgess and Thompson ( 18).\\n3 Mendelian randomization analyses\\nFor our MR analyses, we employed R (version 4.2.2) packages,\\nnamely “TwoSampleMR ” (version 0.5.6) and “MR-PRESSO ”\\n(version 1.0).\\nWe assessed the association b etween hypothyroidism/\\nhyperthyroidism and RA using three methods: inverse variance\\nweighted (IVW), weighted me dian (WM), and Mendelian\\nrandomization-Egger (MR-Egger) methods. IVW method offers\\nconsistent estimates when all genetic variants are valid IVs ( 19).\\nConversely, MR-Egger regression provides consistent estimates,\\nnotably when all considered genetic variants are incorrect IVs.\\nThe weighted median approach generates consistent appraisals,\\nrequiring at least half of the weights to be derived from accurate\\nIVs (20). Our primary result was based on the IVW method, while\\nMR-Egger and WM approaches were used to assess the reliability\\nand stability of the results.\\nWe used the MR-Egger intercept test to detect horizontal\\npleiotropy, with a P-intercept >0.05 indicating the absence of\\nsuch pleiotropy. We further employed the IVW method and\\nEgger regression to evaluate heterogeneity, with P<0.05 indicating\\nits presence. Cochran ’s Q statistic was used to assess heterogeneity\\n(21). Moreover, we conducted a leave-one-out analysis to\\ninvestigate whether a single SNP was driving the causal association.\\n3.1 Univariable MR estimates\\nA rigorous screening process included removing speci ﬁc SNPs,\\nincluding rs6679677, rs13426947, rs3087243, rs34046593,\\nrs2561477, rs2844456, rs6936656, rs1571878, rs12764378,\\nrs706778, rs8032939, and rs34536443 for their associations with\\nconfounders or outcomes.

Furthermore, both conditions share similar\\npathogenic mechanisms involving autoimmune, in ﬂammatory,\\ngenetic, and environmental factors. This study focuses explicitly\\non hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in thyroid dysfunction.\\nThyroid dysfunction, with or without autoimmune thyroid disease\\n(AITD), is observed in 6% to 33.8% of patients with RA ( 23). The\\nresults of a meta-analysis highlight an increased risk of thyroid\\ndysfunction in patients with RA, with a more signi ﬁcant association\\nwith hypothyroidism (OR= 2.25, 95% CI=1.78 –2.84) than\\nhyperthyroidism (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.24 –2.19), consistent with\\nour ﬁndings ( 9). The predominant causes of hyperthyroidism and\\nhypothyroidism are Graves ’ disease and Hashimoto ’s thyroiditis,\\nrespectively. In a study involving 2791 cases of Graves ’ disease and\\n495 cases of Hashimoto ’s thyroiditis, 3.15% of individuals with\\nGraves ’ disease and 4.24% of individuals with Hashimoto ’s\\nthyroiditis had RA ( 24). Furthermore, research by Nisihara et al.\\nrevealed positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in 17.5% of patients\\nwith AITD (excluding rheumatic diseases), with rheumatoid factor\\n(RF) detected in 7.7% of such patients ( 25). In a study by Elnady\\net al., signi ﬁcant differences were observed with ANA (50.8%), RF\\n(34.4%), and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) (19.7%)\\n(26). Conversely, in a cohort study of 800 patients with RA, 9.8%\\nhad AITD, 37.8% tested positive for anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO)\\nantibodies, and 20.8% were positive for anti-thyroglobulin (TG)\\nantibodies ( 27). This evidence suggests an association between RA\\nand hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism, warranting further\\ninvestigation into the underlying mechanisms that link\\nthese conditions.\\nAutoimmune thyroid disease signi ﬁcantly contributes to\\nthyroid dysfunction. Shared physiopathologic mechanisms exist\\namong autoimmune diseases (AD), including RA and AITD ( 28,\\n29). These conditions share common susceptibility genes and\\nenvironmental factors, which c ould account for the higher\\nincidence of autoimmune diseases in affected individuals. Some\\nsusceptibility genes associated with the development of RA include\\nHLA-DRB1, PTPN22, AFF3, CD28, CD40, CTLA4, IL2RA, IL2,\\nIL21, PRKCQ, STAT4, TAGAP, REL, TNFAIP3, TRAF1, BLK,\\nC C L 2 1 ,F C G R 2 A ,P A D I 4 ,a n dP R D M 1(30). Furthermore,\\nsusceptibility genes for AITD include TSHR, TG, HLA, CTLA4,\\nPTPN22, CD40, CD25, ARID 5B, BT61, FCRL3, IL2RA, and\\nFOXP3 ( 31). Among these, PTPN22, CTLA4, HLA_DRB1,\\nFCRL3, and IL2RA are common susceptibility genes between\\nboth conditions, while CD40 is exclusively associated with\\nGraves’ disease and RA ( 32). Regarding environmental factors,\\nsmoking signi ﬁcantly increases the risk of RA ( 33) and Graves ’\\ndisease (\\n34). Surprisingly, smoking has been found to reduce the\\nrisk of hypothyroidism, although this protective effect diminishes in\\nthe years following smoking cessation ( 35–37). Alcohol intake\\nfrequency is protective against RA ( 38, 39). Meanwhile, Carle ́\\ndemonstrated that moderate al cohol intake frequency has\\ndiminished the risk of developing Hashimoto ’s thyroiditis and\\nGraves’ disease ( 40). Furthermore, gut ﬂora dysbiosis has been\\nproposed as an essential environmental factor in developing RA and\\nhypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism ( 41–43). Chen et al. found that\\nanti-tumor necrosis factor treatment (anti-TNF a) in mice reduced\\nthe expression of pro-in ﬂammatory cytokines in the thyroid gland,\\nthereby reducing in ﬂammation ( 44). Hennie et al. showed that in\\nindividuals with RA and hypothyroidism, anti-TNF a therapy was\\nassociated with improved thyroid function ( 45). Moreover, patients\\nreceiving anti-TNF a treatment had a lower incidence of thyroid\\ndisease than those who did not ( 46). Elevated levels of interleukin-1\\n(IL-1) and IL-6 have been associated with the severity of RA and\\njoint damage ( 47, 48). In summary, our study associates RA with\\nhypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism, conﬁrming that RA increases the\\nrisk of hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism, and conversely,\\nhypothyroidism elevates the risk of RA. However, we did not\\nidentify a causal relationship between hyperthyroidism and the\\nrisk of developing RA. We propose that hyperthyroidism might\\nhave a protective effect against RA by potentially increasing T\\nregulatory cells, countering the adverse effects of hyperthyroidism\\non autoimmunity. However, further experimental validation with\\nlarger sample sizes is essential.\\nThe strengths of our study include the utilization of\\nbidirectional two-sample univariable and multivariable MR\\nanalyses to explore the potential causal relationship between RA\\nand hypothyroidism/hyperthy roidism. Furthermore, using\\nexposure and outcome datasets from distinct consortiums\\nminimizes the impact of sample overlap.\\nHowever, this research has several limitations. Firstly, despite\\nemploying an MR design and excluding known confounders, the\\nunaccounted potential confounders could still affect the results.\\nSecondly, this research exclusi vely focused on individuals of\\nEuropean ancestry, which could limit the generalizability of the\\nﬁndings to individuals of other ancestral backgrounds. Therefore,\\ncaution is warranted when interpreting the implications of our\\nﬁndings for broader populations. Thirdly, autoimmune diseases\\ngenerally exhibit a higher susceptibility in women than men.\\nHowever, due to limitations in the available data from the\\noriginal GWAS, we could not stratify the study by sex.\\nFurthermore, our respective indicators for smoking and alcohol\\nconsumption, namely “ cigarettes per day ” and “alcohol intake\\nfrequency\\n” provide a limited perspective as they only re ﬂect the\\nquantity and frequency of smoking and drinking without capturing\\nthe full biological effects. Comprehensive indicators are available,\\nsuch as the duration, frequency, and type of smoking, and the\\ndescription of drinking includes the number of units per\\ndrink, the total weekly alcohol consumption, and the type of\\nalcohol consumed. Therefore, f u r t h e ra n a l y s i si sn e e d e dt o\\ncomprehensively explore the effects of smoking and drinking.\\nFinally, hypothyroidism and hy perthyroidism have complex\\netiologies with multiple subtypes, and the lack of consideration\\nfor these subtypes is a limitation in our MR analysis.\\n5 Conclusion\\nOur study utilized bidirectional two-sample univariable\\nand multivariable MR analytical techniques to investigate a\\npotential causal relationship between RA and hypothyroidism/\\nhyperthyroidism.

This paper investigates the \\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, providing insights into its modular design and the impact of its \\nconstituent modules on performance. Leveraging a unique dataset from Amazon Rainforest natives and biologists, our \\nresearch demonstrates the signiﬁcance of preserving indigenous cultures and biodiversity. The experiment employs a \\ncustomizable RAG methodology, allowing for the interchangeability of various components, such as the base language \\nmodel and similarity score tools. Findings indicate that while GPT performs slightly better when given context, Palm \\nexhibits superior performance without context. The results also suggest that models tend to perform optimally when \\npaired with similarity scores from their native platforms. Conclusively, our approach show cases the potential of a \\nmodular RAG design in optimizing language models, presenting it as a more advantageous strategy compared to tra-\\nditional ﬁne-tuning of large language models. \\nIntroduction \\nThe evolution of natural language processing models has seen signiﬁcant strides from rule -based approaches in the \\nearly stages of language understanding, eventually leading to the advent of neural networks. However, the full potential \\nof these neural netw orks awaited the computational infrastructure to catch up. The pivotal moment arrived with the \\nemergence of neural machine translation (NMT), exempliﬁed by Google Translate, which marked a turning point in \\nmachine language comprehension (Bahdanau, 2016). Subsequently, a plethora of advanced models, including BERT, \\nTransformers, GPT-2, and GPT-3, have emerged, driving the ﬁeld forward. Recent notable additions to this landscape \\nare models like GPT and Bard (Devlin, 2018) (Vaswani, 2017) (Radford, 2018). While ﬁne -tuning such models has \\nproven to be a challenging endeavor, it has become evident that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) oﬀers a prom-\\nising alternative (Lewis, 2020) (Siriwardhana, 2023) (Yu, 2022). \\nCuriously, little attention has been devoted to dissecting the individual components of RAG and their respec-\\ntive impacts on overall performance. In response to this gap, our paper undertakes a comprehensive investigation of \\nthe RAG framework and embarks on the design of RAG models from the ground up, with a focus on the modularity \\nand replaceability of its constituent modules. This research seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mech-\\nanisms underlying RAG and its potential for enhancing natural language understanding and generation. These Large \\nLanguage Models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable proﬁciency in replicating human language styles, achieving a level of \\nlinguistic verisimilitude that borders on the impeccable. In light of these capabilities, it is prudent to delve into the \\nprofound signiﬁcance of the Amazon rainforest, which equates to the importance of any ethnically or racially diverse \\nnation across the globe. Within the vast expanse of the Amazon, an intricate tapestry of life unfolds, where millions \\nof distinct species intermingle. Each of these species, as rare as the other, holds a unique and intrinsic value to the \\nindigenous populations who have made this ecosystem their home. The Amazon rainforest is not only a cradle of \\nbiological diversity but also a sanctuary for an array of religions and cultures, many of which teeter on the brink of \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n1'),\n",

Preserving the Amazon is not merely an environmental imperative; it is an act of justice to the indigenous \\ncommunities whose ancestral lands are enshrined within its boundaries. It is a call to safeguard the memories of the \\nland, the traditions that have evolved within its embrace, and the very essence of their cultures. However, certain \\nregions of the Amazon remain shrouded in obscurity, their ﬂora and fauna so rare that reliable and readily available \\ninformation is conspicuously lacking in the vast repository of knowledge available on the internet. In this context, \\nadvanced LLMs play an instrumental role in addressing this deﬁcit by facilitating the dissemination of indigenous \\nnarratives and thereby amplifying awareness and appreciation of the rich tapestry of beliefs, practices, and traditional \\nknowledge that these communities hold dear. They serve as a bridge connecting the indigenous Amazonian cultures \\nwith the global community, emphasizing the paramount importance of preserving the cultural diversity interwoven \\nwithin this vast rainforest. In sum, the overarching mission of this endeavor is twofold: to document and educate the \\nWestern world about hitherto unknown cultures while concurrently ensuring the enduring preservation of these inval-\\nuable facets of human heritage and biodiversity. \\n \\nProposed Experiment \\n \\nBackground and Importance \\n \\nThe intrinsic value of indigenous knowledge, especially from regions as biodiverse and culturally rich as the Amazon \\nRainforest, cannot be overstated. This knowledge, passed down through generations, encompasses not only cultural \\nand religious beliefs but also practical insights into the local ﬂora and fauna. As the modern world encroaches on these \\nlands, this wisdom is in peril of being lost forever. Recognizing this, our proposed experiment aims to employ a state-\\nof-the-art Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to capture and leverage this  vast, yet vulnerable, \\nknowledge base. \\nOur dataset, derived from interviews with Amazon Rainforest natives and biologists, is unparalleled in its \\ndepth and breadth.

It is a rich compendium of verbal histories, inter-\\nviews, and ecological insights gathered from the indigenous peoples of the Amazon Rainforest, as well as from biolo-\\ngists and ecologists dedicated to studying this unique biome. The dataset is characterized by its diversity, comprising \\nnarratives that elucidate the intricate relationship between the natives and their environment, including the religious \\nand cultural signiﬁcance of plant and animal life. \\nThe data collection was an extensive process, where linguists and researchers engaged in deep conversations \\nwith the natives, recording their dialects, translating their stories, and documenting their knowledge of the ecological \\nsystem. Similarly, biologists contributed their decades of research on the ﬂora and fauna, providing a scientiﬁc per-\\nspective to the indigenous narratives. The data thus forms a conﬂuence of traditional wisdom and modern scientiﬁc \\nunderstanding, oﬀering a 360-degree view of the Amazon Rainforest's ecosystem. \\n \\nCultural and Environmental Signiﬁcance \\n \\nThe urgency of preserving indigenous knowledge is akin to conserving an endangered species. It is a race against time, \\nas globalization and environmental degradation threaten to erase unique cultures and the wisdom they hold. Our dataset \\nserves as a digital ark, a means to preserve and perpetuate the knowledge that has sustained the Amazon's communities \\nfor millennia. \\nThe environmental signiﬁcance of the Amazon Rainforest cannot be overstated—it is a keystone of global \\nbiodiversity. By documenting the intricate knowledge, the natives have of their environment, we are also chronicling \\nthe ecological interdependencies that are vital for the rainforest's survival. This dataset, therefore, is not just an aca-\\ndemic or technological asset; it is a critical record for environmental conservationists and policymakers. \\nThrough our experiment, we aim to amplify the voices of the Amazon's indigenous peoples, whose under-\\nstanding of their habitat is unmatched. By integrating their knowledge into the RAG framework, we hope to create a \\nmodel that not only responds with information but also with wisdom  that respects the interconnectedness of life and \\nculture. \\n \\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Framework \\n \\nThe heart of our experiment lies in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, a sophisticated algorithm \\nthat enables the deconstruction of the language model into discrete, interchangeable components. This framework \\nintegrates a retriever model t hat sources relevant context and a generator model that synthesizes the retrieved infor-\\nmation into coherent responses. \\nIn mathematical terms, given an input query 𝑞𝑞, the retriever model searches a knowledge base 𝒦𝒦 and retrieves \\na set of relevant documents 𝐷𝐷= {𝑑𝑑1, 𝑑𝑑2, … , 𝑑𝑑𝑘𝑘}. Each document 𝑑𝑑 is represented as a vector 𝐯𝐯𝑑𝑑 in a high-dimensional \\nspace, obtained from an embedding layer. This process transforms the raw text data into a structured form amenable \\nto computational manipulation. \\nTo examine the eﬀects of component interchangeability, we adopt various base language models and similar-\\nity scoring mechanisms. For instance, if 𝐸𝐸denotes the embedding function, and 𝑠𝑠 and 𝑡𝑡 represent the input and target \\ntext sequences, respectively, their vector representations would be 𝐯𝐯𝑠𝑠= 𝐸𝐸(𝑠𝑠) and 𝐯𝐯𝑡𝑡= 𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡). We employ cosine simi-\\nlarity as the basis for our similarity score, deﬁned by the formula: \\nsimilarity(𝐯𝐯𝑠𝑠, 𝐯𝐯𝑡𝑡) = 𝐯𝐯𝑠𝑠 ⋅ 𝐯𝐯𝑡𝑡\\n�|v𝑠𝑠|� �|v𝑡𝑡|� \\nHere, ⋅ denotes the dot product between the two vectors, and �|⋅|� denotes the Euclidean norm. This score quantiﬁes \\nthe closeness of the semantic meaning represented by the vectors, with a value of 1 indicating identical directionality \\nand thus, maximal similarity.  \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n3\"),\n",

For the training phase, \\nwe deﬁne the following: \\nℒ: The base language model, which can be either GPT or Palm. \\n𝒟𝒟: The training dataset, consisting of pairs  (𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖, 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖) where 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 is a query from the dataset and 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 is the corresponding \\nanswer. \\nThe language model ℒ is ﬁne-tuned on 𝒟𝒟, optimizing the weights to minimize the loss function, typically a \\ncross-entropy loss between the predicted and actual answers.  \\nFollowing training, the question-answering process involves feeding a new query 𝑞𝑞′ to the trained model and retrieving \\nthe answer 𝑎𝑎′. This answer is then compared to a predeﬁned list of correct answers using the similarity score, which is \\nfundamental to evaluating the model's performance. \\n \\nBenchmarking and Evaluation \\n \\nThe evaluation metric for our experiment is based on the similarity scores between the generated responses and a set \\nof reference answers. Let 𝐴𝐴= {𝑎𝑎1\\n′ , 𝑎𝑎2\\n′ , … , 𝑎𝑎𝑛𝑛\\n′ } be the set of answers generated by the model, and 𝐴𝐴ref = {𝑎𝑎1\\n∗, 𝑎𝑎2\\n∗ , … , 𝑎𝑎𝑛𝑛\\n∗ } \\nbe the set of reference answers. We deﬁne the average similarity score as follows: \\nScoreavg = 1\\nn � similarity(𝐯𝐯𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖\\n′ , 𝐯𝐯𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖\\n∗ )\\n𝑛𝑛\\n𝑖𝑖=1\\n \\nThis average score acts as the primary benchmark for comparing diﬀerent model conﬁgurations. We systematically \\nrecord the scores across various combinations of language models and similarity scoring mechanisms to assess which \\nconﬁgurations yield the highest average similarity, indicating the most eﬀective model setup for our dataset. \\nAdditionally, we account for the presence or absence of context in the model's training and response genera-\\ntion. This is critical, as the presence of context has been shown to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence model performance, particu-\\nlarly in the domain of indigenous knowledge and biodiversity, where context provides essential background information \\nthat can drastically aﬀect the meaning and relevance of a response. \\nThrough this meticulous experimental setup, we aim to illuminate the intricate dynamics between diﬀerent \\ncomponents of the RAG framework and their collective impact on the model's ability to accurately replicate and convey \\nthe richness of the Amazon Rainforest's cultural and ecological knowledge. \\n \\nPre-Experiment Performance Expectations and Discussion \\n \\nIn the landscape of varying conﬁgurations, we hypothesize that certain setups will yield higher average similarity \\nscores than others, indicative of more nuanced and accurate language generation. Particularly, we expect that: \\nThe similarity scores for models trained with contextual data 𝐯𝐯context will surpass those trained without, due to the \\nenriched understanding and background the model has of the subject matter. \\nWhen aligning models with their native embeddings (e.g., GPT with OpenAI Embed, Palm with Palm Em-\\nbed), the semantic vector representations (𝐯𝐯𝑠𝑠, 𝐯𝐯𝑡𝑡) should align more closely, thus producing higher similarity scores. \\nThe modular nature of the RAG setup will reveal that certain combinations of base language models and similarity \\nscoring mechanisms are more eﬀective than others, depending on whether context is included or not. \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n4\"),\n",

It emphasizes the role that technology can play in safeguarding intangible heritage, a mission that aligns \\nwith the broader objectives of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage initiatives. It serves as a model for how com-\\nmunities around the world can leverage technology to protect and share their unique cultural identities and knowledge \\nsystems. \\n \\nAdvancements in RAG Framework \\n \\nFrom a methodological standpoint, our experiment is poised to contribute to the advancement of the RAG framework \\nwithin the realm of AI language models.

This allows the user to add certain parts / combina-\\ntions to test the performance of those then to substitute diﬀerent modules in to see which leads to the largest perfor-\\nmance increase over the other. These customizable steps allow you to see minute diﬀerences in performance that slowly \\ntuning a model couldn’t have shown you previously. This is a novel way to approach the tuning of LLM and will only \\nserve to increase their accuracy as time moves forward. \\nAnother major component of our RAG methodology is the ability to switch out which embedding layer you \\nuse. The standard embedding (OpenAI) or Palm’s embed. When choosing between both of those some tradeoﬀs are \\nmade. \\nWhen using no context, Palm’s embedding layer seems to perform much better across the board, allowing for \\na much higher average similarity score, however this drastically shifts when given context as now OpenAI’s embedding \\nlayer performs much more soundly. The evidence for these claims is discussed later in this paper. \\nAdditionally, another beneﬁcial feature of the RAG optimization and breakdown style is the ability to cus-\\ntomize which similarity score the LLM uses to decide which answer to base its response oﬀ from the Q -A list. To go \\ninto further detail, the code when prompted with a user question compares the user question to the Q-A list and reorders \\nthe list based oﬀ highest similarity score to lowest, this allows the LLM to select the top 2 -3 answers to the highest \\nranked questions and continue generating its own response from there. \\nThe ﬁrst choice of similarity score was STS OpenAI Score while the second was STS Palm Score.

This is a novel and important way to be able to break down LLM \\nand the data collected speaks a lot to the importance of each aspect of an LLM. \\nIn terms of expected results, two things were noticed, ﬁrst that Palm had a slightly lower performance than \\nGPT (0.996 versus 0.997 respectively) on their top runs, however, there was also some contradictory data as it seemed \\nthat Palm worked signiﬁcantly better when given no context to work with compared to GPT, Palm produced an average \\nscore of 0.88 and 0.91 when given no context while GPT produced an average score of 0.75 and 0.897.

A similar eﬀect was noticed going the other way around as well, without context, GPT  \\nperformed much better with Palm embedding layer than with its own OpenAI embedding layer (0.897 versus 0.75 \\nrespectively). This data shows how Palm embedding layer tends to perform much better given no context when com-\\npared to OpenAI ’s embed. Similarly, to explored above, it is the opposite when given context, however. OpenAI’s \\nembedding layer performs a bit better when given context across the board than Palm embed. \\nMost notably from this experiment was two realizations. First, that Palm Embedding layer tends to work much \\nbetter when just given its own proprietary dataset (and no context), when compared to OpenAI’s embed. Additionally, \\nwhen given context, the playing ﬁeld switches: Palm tends to perform much worse when given context when compared \\nto OpenAI. Lastly, it is important to note that a combination of Palm/GPT with OpenAI’s embedding layer and context \\nyielded extremely accurate results when its similarity scores were averaged. \\n \\nConclusion \\n \\nBuilding upon the foundation laid by our initial ﬁndings, it is paramount to recognize the exceptional performance of \\nthe Palm model when utilizing its proprietary dataset in conjunction with the Palm embed. This speciﬁcity in data and \\ntechnology synchronization has shown that Palm outshines OpenAI in terms of model accuracy in a context-free envi-\\nronment. However, the landscape shifts when contextual data is integrated. In such scenarios, the combination of GPT \\nwith its native OpenAI embedding layer excels, leveraging the additional context to produce responses of remarkable \\naccuracy that resonate with the cultural and ecological nuances of the Amazon. \\nThis pivot in performance based on context underscores the signiﬁcance of tailored datasets and embedding \\nmechanisms in the optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs). The adaptability of the Retrieval -Augmented \\nGeneration (RAG) framework emerges as a cornerstone for future enhancements in LLMs. By enabling the seamless \\ninterchange of model components, RAG presents an evolutionary leap in the ﬁne-tuning of language models, catering \\nto the intricate demands of culturally rich and contextually complex datasets. \\nIn light of these advancements, our research signiﬁes a pivotal moment for LLMs. The evidence suggests that \\nwhen models are ﬁnely tuned with an awareness of the dataset's inherent context and the corresponding embedding \\nlayers, they reach new heights of linguistic precision. Therefore, the path forward for LLMs lies in embracing the \\nmodular and contextually aware RAG framework, which promises to reﬁne the capabilities of language models to an \\nunprecedented degree, ensuring the preservation and celebration of the world's diverse linguistic and cultural heritage. \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n8\"),\n",

Regardless of this literature,\\nthere is limited evidence of the unmet needs and\\nexperiences of adults with ADHD (Matheson et al.\\n2013). It is common among adults with ADHD to\\nexperience high rates of co-morbidities; three in four\\npatients have at least one or more co-morbid psychia-\\ntric disorder (Faraone & Biederman, 1998). In some\\ncases, these other psychiatric disorders can dominate\\nthe picture, causing symptoms of ADHD to be over-\\nlooked or even undiagnosed.

Regardless of this literature,\\nthere is limited evidence of the unmet needs and\\nexperiences of adults with ADHD (Matheson et al.\\n2013). It is common among adults with ADHD to\\nexperience high rates of co-morbidities; three in four\\npatients have at least one or more co-morbid psychia-\\ntric disorder (Faraone & Biederman, 1998). In some\\ncases, these other psychiatric disorders can dominate\\nthe picture, causing symptoms of ADHD to be over-\\nlooked or even undiagnosed.

The prevalence of hyperthyroidism ranges\\nfrom 0.2% to 1.3% ( 6, 7), while that of hypothyroidism varies from\\n0.2 to 5.3% ( 6, 8). Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism could\\nimpact various bodily systems, including the integumentary,\\nmuscular, skeletal, cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, endocrine,\\nand circulatory systems.
